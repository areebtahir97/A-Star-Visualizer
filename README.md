# A-Star-Visualizer
A-Star Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer in Python.
This algorithm is used to find the minimum distance path from source to target and in graph traversal.What makes A-Star a better path finding algorithm than others is that it uses a heuristic function, H(n), which guides the path in an efficient way.Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm,it does not go to every node/cube in search of minimum path but judges the next node on the grid with the help of the heuristic function.Many application which require path finding like Google Maps,Apple Maps use A-Star algorithm.I have used the 2D graphics module-PYGAME in pyhton for visualizing the algorithm in a 50*50 grid.You can change the grid size by changing the ROWS. 
Instructions-
1.Press MOUSE1 to set the source and the target.
2.Press SPACE to start the algorithm.
3.Once the algorithm is finished and the min distance path is achieved.Press C to clear the grid.

Note: The speed of the algorithm depends on the hardware you are running.
